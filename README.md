# Agile Board

Yet another agile board, but this one is not like the others, because it is mine, ha ha.

_Note: This project is a sandbox for me to test features of Node.js and React.js. I always commit stable states, but code can sometimes be incoherent_

## How to use it

-   Clone the repo
-   Go to the backend folder
-   Install dependencies (`npm install` or `yarn install`)
-   Launch app (`npm run dev` or `yarn dev`)
-   Go to the webapp folder
-   Install dependencies (`npm install` or `yarn install`)
-   Launch app (`npm run dev` or `yarn dev`)

## Install the database

This application needs a database to work. Only mysql is compatible for now.

Use **schema.sql** and **test-data.sql** located in the database folder to fill your database.

You can use **fill-db.sh** (Linux) of **fill-db.cmd** (Windows) to create and fill the database.

You can configure the database connection by editing **config/index.js** file in backend/api folder.

## What's comming next

Next US to be developed are:

-   I can connect to the application
-   I can have adapted rights when using the application
-   I can disconnect from the application
-   I can assign tickets to a sprint
-   I can change a sprint's state
-   I can see a sprint's burndown
-   I can configure my application by environment

## See a demo

Sorry, no demo is available for now =( But it'll come soon!
